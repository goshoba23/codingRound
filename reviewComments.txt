Review Comments :

1. Lack of abstraction 
	I have extracted the methods of test files into seperate classes : Helper, WebDriverInitialize and pageObject class
2. Mixed declaration of WedElements. In few files directly inside test and in the other as @FindBy
	I have declared most of the variables using @FindBy inside the pageObject class
3. Common methods directly defined within test files
	Created a seperate Helper file to hold all the common non driver related methods.
